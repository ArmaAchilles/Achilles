Ares is a mod aimed expanding the tools available to Zeus so that it is possible to create more varied and compelling missions. The goal is to add simple useful functionality to Zeus without requiring extra mods running on other clients or the server.

Ares is designed to work with dedicated servers which may be running missions that allow JIP and respawn. The new functionality it is aimed at running with trusted players in a structured mission and is not recommended for general 'public server' play.

Requirements:
As of V.1.8.0 Ares requires @CBA_A3 for some functionality. Please ensure it is running alongside @Ares if you are using Zeus. Clients that aren't running @Ares (e.g. non-zeus players) do not need to run @CBA_A3.
You can download the latest version of CBA from the developer website here: http://dev.withsix.com/projects/cca/wiki/CBA
