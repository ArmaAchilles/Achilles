####Description
This Arma III Add-on expands Zeus Functionalities with new Modules

####Status
In development

####Aims
First of all, I want to thank to [Anton Struyk for his Ares Mod](https://github.com/astruyk/Ares). No one would argue that this mod changed completely the way we play Zeus.
Based on this mod I used “execute code” module a lot for implementing new features. However, I realized that there are excellent Zeus players out there, who might not be familiar with scripting. Hence, I want to give them the opportunity to have access to new features as well. That is why I came up with the plan of this new expansion.
 
The add-on will be based on a modified version of Ares Mod and can be run without additional add-ons.
Moreover, only zeus need to have the add-on installed as it was the case for Ares Mod.
